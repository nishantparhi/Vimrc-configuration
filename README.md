# My Vimrc configuration

In my .vimrc, I have made some custom changes which help me to work with `vim` easily. 

To make changes in your `.vimrc` you can use `nnoremap`

**Let me give you an example on how it works**

1. Open you `.vimrc` in your favorite text editor
2. Towards the last line add `nnoremap <C-c> :qa!<CR>`
    * Capital `C` is `Ctrl key` and small `c` is `the key c`
